# Hammer
```
🙏 Hammer is currently under active development. The api can break/change without notice.
```

Hammer is a modulair CMS with a small core. Everything in Hammer is a plugin (except the templates) an can be overwritten. The aim with Hammer is to create a flexible CMS that is focused on serving content based websites (yes Hammer is not another blog CMS 😱).

## Getting started

```
npm install projecthammer
```
or
```
yarn add projecthammer
```

The next thing that we have to do is create a small project that starts Hammer.

```
let Hammer = require('projecthammer');
new Hammer();
```

Yes it is as simple as that. Hammer is now up and running on port 8080. 🎉
